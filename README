Welcome to use DarkWorld's debugger.

Discription:
Dwbugger is a lightweight dynamic debugger for RE in assembly-language level.
All of it's dubug-function is implemented via ptrace. So it doesn't need read
permission.
It can inset breakpoint, peek values of memory or registers, alter
values of memory or registers, continue, step by step etc. Enjoy it.

 
Advantage:
Needs no read permission. And it has the basic functions.
    
Disadvantage:
It ONLY has basic functions, and doesn't offer any information of symbols.


Command:
help:
	Print help information
disass/disassembly <address>
	Disassembly address's machine code

        Example:
        diass 0x08048300
        
peek/[len][format flag] <memory address or register>
	Show values of memory address or registers.

        format flag:
        b : unsigned char
        x : unsigned int
        s : print string

        registers:
        $regs : print all regs' values
        $eip  : print eip's value
        $esp  : print esp's value
        $ebp  : print ebp's value
        $eax  : print eax's value

        Example:
        peek 0x08048300
        peek/123b 0x08048300
        peek/24x 0x08048300
        peek $regs
        peek $eip
        
poke <memory address or register>=<value>
        Alter value of memory address or register

        Registers:
        $eip  : alter eip's value
        $esp  : alter esp's value
        $ebp  : alter ebp's value
        $eax  : alter eax's value
        
        Example:
        poke 0x08048300=0xdeadbeef
        poke $eip=0x080483f1
